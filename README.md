# Kagami 

Fun little app that can be used to generate symmetric image out of any image.

## What do I need to run this?

Install the latest `pillow` from pip and then run `main.py`.

## Future works

* Support for batch conversion of images inside folders
* More robust image pre-processing (resize, crop, etc.)
* You tell me!
